ChessAI
=====================================================

Approach to build a program that beats me in the game of chess.

**********************************

### DEPENDENCIES
- [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - move generation, move validation and support for common formats
- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - lightweight WSGI web application framework
- [torch](https://pytorch.org/) - open source machine learning framework

I need an approach that evaluates a given board state and comes up with a good move to perform.

Why is it hard?
- ~10^40 legal board states
- ~10^120 different chess games
- ~30 moves per board state
- typical chess game ~80 moves

TODO: describe PGN notation and training data in general (how much etc.)

### 1st approach: [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
- minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario
- reasonably works up to a search depth of *3*
- already surprinsingly good opponent, but beatable
- **improvement**
    - [alphaâ€“beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
    - decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm and therefore the computation time
    - allows to search faster and works reasonably up to a depth of *4*

### 2nd approach: Neural Network
- **mapping**: board state -> move to be performed
- need a lot of chess games to train with
